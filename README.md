Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program requires the development team to listen to and extrapolate details from their clients. Creating user stories from the information obtained from the clients allows the development team to see who is going to use this part of the software, how they would like it to act, and how it will help them accomplish a goal. Understanding the users' criteria for a successful product is very important. Making sure to keep the client involved in the process will help avoid developing functionality that will end up not being used.
I like to have a clear understanding of what is expected as I begin working on a software project. This probably is a result of working in environments that were mostly using the waterfall method. However, I have seen how using the agile method can provide the client with value quickly. I think that having task tracking and user stories will be very helpful in future development activities.
I think that being a good team member in software development involves good communication practices, being able to ask for help if having difficulty, and offering help to other members of the team if they are having difficulty.
